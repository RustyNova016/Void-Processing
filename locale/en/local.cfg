[technology-description]
promethium-crushing=Promethium is a great building block for void cores, however it needs some processing.
promethium-void-culture=Iron and copper bacteria seems possible to be mutated to transform the promethium
void-crystals=The cultures cannot create proper void crystals by themselves, but by using a proper base and aquilo's frigid temperature, they should be able to grow nice crystals
void-core-chunk=The crystals must be properly treated before getting turned into cores. 
void-core-base=The chunks can be assembled by simply heating them to high temperatures. However they need to be annealed slowly to prevent the base from cracking. This should be easy, as crystalization platings also need to get annealed... Right? 
void-core-activation=The final step. It only needs a strong electromagnetic field to activate the core
voidp-void-science-pack=The end! For now...

# Intermediaries
crystalization-plating=Lithium-holmium alloy makes a great base to grow crystals on. But this requires controled annealing that returns room temperature fluoroketone, and one more temperature to deal with
void-control-unit=Researching promethium will brings you this ancient forgotten technology. WDYM "It's just an asset swap"?
void-data-disk=Store matter as data. 512 megatyrons max.

# Void conversion
void-conversion-1=Research ways to turn matter into void
void-conversion-2=Research ways to turn matter into void, the return
void-conversion-3=Research ways to turn matter into void, the trilogy

black-hole-approach=Oratl's approach

[space-location-description]
black-hole=A black hole found on the way to the shattered planet. No asteroids can be found around it, but it might be useful for something else... This beauty is worth the detour, no?
